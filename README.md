# WebKriti2020
This is a Travel Blog
Designed By: Pranshu Saxena, Subodh Rajpopat and Tathagata Paul (1st yr) for Web Kriti 2020.
We have used basic html, css and javascript templates to make this.
No bootstrap classes were used.
We have used ejs as a templating engine along with ejs layouts, gsap (for animations) and scroll magic.
We have used Node JS along with Express for backend and MySQL for database.
Other dependencies include express-session, sweetalert2, bcrypt, body-parser, nodemon.
