# WebKriti2020
This is a <strong>Travel Blog</strong><br>
Designed By: Pranshu Saxena, Subodh Rajpopat and Tathagata Paul (1st yr) for WebKriti 2020.<br>
We have used basic html, css and javascript templates to make this.<br>
No bootstrap classes were used.<br>
We have used ejs as a templating engine along with ejs layouts, gsap (for animations) and scroll magic.<br>
We have used Node JS along with Express for backend and MySQL for database.<br>
Other dependencies include express-session, sweetalert2, bcrypt, body-parser.<br>
